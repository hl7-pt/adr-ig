# HL7 PT IG Life cycle


The guidelines for publishing a HL7 Portugal chapter Implementation guide:

1. Fork this empty IG and start developing 
2. Present the (ongoing) development to the HL7 Portugal committee for commentary
3. The project is then introduced in the HL7PT Organization as draft with commitee commentaries
4. IG is present to public commentary
5. IG is voted
6. IG is published in the HL7 Portugal website

With new version releases, the website will follow an analogous format of the fhir resources like .../ig/\<ig name\>/\<version\>
